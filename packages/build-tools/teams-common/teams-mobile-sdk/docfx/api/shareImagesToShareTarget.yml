      Share images to a target. Calling this method opens the respective chat or

      channel view on top of the current view. The images specified in

      `imageHandles` are added to the compose box. If multiple images are

      specified, each of them appears on a new line i.e. the images are

      vertically stacked.


      > [!NOTE]

      > Calling this method takes the user out of your app.


      > [!NOTE]

      > Image handles can be obtained via `ImageAndFilePicker` APIs.
