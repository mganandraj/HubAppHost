## Jest docs
We are using Jest as our testing framework.
Visit https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started for documentation and examples.

## Instructions for maintaining tests
1. Add tests when you are writing a new feature.
2. Update existing tests if any existing functionality is modified and/or existing tests break.
3. As a general guideline, add a test file per-class. Follow the convention ClassName.test.ts
4. Update this file with info if any tests you are adding are not as per existing conventions.
